## About

Modus is an open-source desktop app for running AI coding agents inside real local projects.

Open a workspace, connect your own model provider, plan or build, inspect changes, approve risky actions, and keep the full workflow in one window.

Modus is early and currently runs best from source.

## Features

- **Workspaces and sessions** - Open local projects, switch recent workspaces, pin projects, and keep separate agent sessions per repo.
- **Bring your own models** - Configure built-in or custom PI-compatible providers, defaults, reasoning effort, thinking variants, and model limits.
- **Git workflow** - Review working tree changes, file diffs, branches, commit history, commits, pushes, and session change stats.
- **Terminal, browser, and files** - Use a real PTY terminal, an in-app browser with tabs and DevTools, and a workspace file explorer.
- **Fast Codebase** - Let the agent build a compact local code map before reading files, reducing broad grep/read exploration.
- **Subagents** - Create specialized subagents, track their activity, and apply or clean up their worktrees.
- **Plan and build modes** - Start with a reviewable plan, answer structured questions, then move into implementation.
- **Context and images** - Attach files, folders, docs, Git diffs, terminal output, browser state, selected page elements, rules, and images.
- **MCP, skills, and rules** - Load Modus MCP servers, invoke local skills with `/`, and apply project rules from AGENTS/Claude/Cursor-style files.
- **Permissioned execution** - Route shell, Git, browser, MCP, file, and external actions through one approval flow.
- **Checkpoints and rollback** - Snapshot the workspace before agent runs and restore from the timeline when needed.

## Repo layout

```text
apps/desktop/     Electron product (main / preload / renderer)
crates/pty-host/  Rust PTY sidecar (modus-pty-host)
catalog/          Generated model provider catalog
docs/             Architecture notes and media
scripts/          Model catalog generator
```

The desktop app is self-contained under `apps/desktop`. Shared types and tools live in `apps/desktop/src/shared`, not in separate workspace packages.

## Getting Started

Requirements:

- Node.js `>= 22.19.0`
- npm
- Rust + Cargo (recent stable; crate uses edition 2024)
- Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stoltembergg-png/modus.git
cd modus
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open a workspace folder and configure a model provider in Settings.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
npm run test
npm --workspace @modus/desktop run typecheck
npm --workspace @modus/desktop run build:pty
npm --workspace @modus/desktop run build
```

`npm run check` runs Biome plus workspace typechecks. Biome format/lint may still report pre-existing issues on some branches; prefer `typecheck` + `test` as the local gate until a format sweep lands.

Package locally:

```bash
npm --workspace @modus/desktop run package:win -- --publish never
npm --workspace @modus/desktop run package:mac -- --publish never
npm --workspace @modus/desktop run package:linux -- --publish never
```

Run the platform-matching package command on that OS.

## MCP Config

Modus only auto-loads its own MCP config files:

```text
~/.modus/mcp.json
<workspace>/.modus/mcp.json
```

It does not silently import Cursor, Claude, Warp, or other agent configs.

## Tech Stack

Electron, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Base UI, Motion, Monaco, xterm.js, Streamdown, Node SQLite, Rust `portable-pty`, `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, and the MCP SDK.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Keep PRs small, use Conventional Commits, and run `npm run test` plus `npm --workspace @modus/desktop run typecheck` before opening a PR.
